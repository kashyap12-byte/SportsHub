            <h2>My first : A World Cup final for a rookie journalist</h2>
            <li class="news-page-more">I had covered the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) Season 4 right before the World Cup took place, and even interviewed a few players when they came over to my city for the Bengaluru leg. However, travelling to a different state and meeting so many known, unknown, lesser-known players was an experience I had never had before.</li>
            <li class="news-page-more">I remember landing in Ahmedabad a day before the semi-finals, and directly heading to TransStadia for a press conference with the teams. All packed up and awkward, I entered the stadium with some heavy baggage (no, literally) and was amazed at how the team captains and coaches were happily chatting away and eating like it was a regular get-together. I immediately felt comfortable. These were not stars, there were no airs. To my surprise, I could go and talk to anyone I wanted to in the group. There were very few people from the media, not more than six to seven publications -- kabaddi was getting popular, yes, but PKL's true riches were still a couple of years into the future for the players and the sport.</li>
            <li class="news-page-more">Now here was the thing. They all knew kabaddi was 'India's sport', so losing the World Cup wasn't even an option for these players. On the other hand, Iran had a strong team. Captain Meraj Sheykh had played against half the Indian team at the PKL and knew exactly what their strengths and weaknesses were. This strategy worked until the first half, and Iran led by a distance. The second half, though, as we all know, saw Ajay Thakur come into his own like never before as he led India to yet another victory. The loudest cheers, though, came for local boy Parmar, who didn't even play the match.</li>
