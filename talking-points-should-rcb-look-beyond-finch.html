            <h2>Talking Points: Should RCB look beyond Aaron Finch?</h2>
            <li class="news-page-more">It had seemed like a smart buy at the auctions: buy an established, experienced and aggressive top-order batsman to spread the batting load away from Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers - but the Royal Challengers' acquisition of Aaron Finch hasn't quite panned out that way. He's played every match for the team this season, but the returns have been poor apart from a 35-ball 52 against the Mumbai Indians. His average this season is 20.66, but it's the strike rate of 109.73 that is the bigger problem. Devdutt Padikkal's good form has covered for Finch's lack of impetus at the top, but Padikkal also couldn't get going today, which meant the Royal Challengers had their lowest powerplay score in the tournament so far: 36 for 1.</li>
            <li class="news-page-more">Their options, if they drop Finch, are Moeen Ali or Josh Philippe. Both come with their advantages. Moeen offers an offspin option. He can slot into the middle order while Kohli goes back to opening. Philippe is also a multi-skilled player, and can take the gloves back from de Villiers if he's in the XI. Moreover, his natural spot is opening, so it would be a straight swap for Finch, while also giving the Royal Challengers the addition of de Villiers the fielder, which alone potentially adds/saves a fair few runs.</li>

            <li class="news-page-more">Why send a man on IPL debut in against that kind of asking rate? The Super Kings batted deep, which in theory should have given them the flexibility to go hard, regardless of wickets lost early. And in the likes of Sam Curran, Dwayne Bravo and Ravindra Jadeja, they had just the type of batsmen who could be sent up the order to inject momentum in the chase when it was flagging. That is, of course, considering that MS Dhoni the finisher might have wanted to come in only during the second half. Curran and Jadeja would have provided a left-hand option too, to complement Rayudu, and both have shown in this very tournament that their hitting form is intact.</li>
