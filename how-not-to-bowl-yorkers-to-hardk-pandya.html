            <h2>How not to bowl yorkers to Hardik Pandya</h2>
            <li class="news-page-more">Only a few weeks ago, Sandeep Sharma and T Natarajan had frustrated Hardik Pandya in the death overs by bowling yorkers from a specific angle (left-arm over/right-arm round the wicket). There were no variations, no bluffs and nothing unpredictable. Even as Hardik tried to shuffle across the crease, open up his stance a bit and attempt other counter plans, he failed to get the kind of contact that enables him to clear the boundary ropes. It seemed then that the blueprint to contain him had been laid out.Only a few weeks ago, Sandeep Sharma and T Natarajan had frustrated Hardik Pandya in the death overs by bowling yorkers from a specific angle (left-arm over/right-arm round the wicket).

It seemed then that the blueprint to contain him had been laid out.</li>
            <li class="news-page-more">Yet, no team managed to successfully replicate that plan. Delhi Capitals, however, preferred to try their luck in Qualifier 1. In their arsenal, they had three death bowlers of repute plus the additional pace that SRH didn't. They changed the line but stuck to the same length of attack. In parts, they would've realised that it was a good ploy as Hardik failed to get hold of the yorkers. The caveat, though, lied in the effects of the yorker that isn't perfectly executed. After all, bowling yorkers is one of the toughest skills, as some of the best exponents of the delivery have admitted.</li>
            <li class="news-page-more">With Hardik, the quest of getting the perfect yorker becomes even tougher as he stands deep inside his crease, altering the conventional yorker length to a delivery in the slot. Additionally, attempts to pitch too full often ends up becoming a low full toss. Thus, even as yorkers did command its effects on him, the margin for error with the delivery was extremely low. On four of the five occasions they missed the perfect length, the bowlers were carted for sixes. When they got the yorkers right, he managed to eke out only two from four deliveries.</li>
