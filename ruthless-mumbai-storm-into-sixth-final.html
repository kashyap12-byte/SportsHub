            <h2>Ruthless Mumbai Storm into sixth final</h2>
            <li class="news-page-more">Mumbai Indians put on a thoroughly dominant performance in the first qualifier and booked a spot in an IPL final for the sixth time. Despite losing the toss, Mumbai Indians never allowed Delhi Capitals as much as a sniff, staying ahead of the game throughout with both bat and ball.</li>
            <li class="news-page-more">Bringing about shots of the highest quality, Mumbai Indians scored 63 in the powerplay seemingly without any risk taken. It started with Quinton de Kock timing a couple of on-drives to perfection in the first over bowled by Daniel Sams. And while R Ashwin got the better of Rohit Sharma first ball, the attack at the other end was relentless. Ashwin was driven through covers, Rabada's cutter was heaved away on the onside, Axar Patel was smashed over long on as de Kock raced away to 38 off 21. Joining in on the fun soon enough was Suryakumar Yadav who put away Nortje to the deep midwicket fence twice in two balls before lofting Ashwin over long off for a six. Delhi had bowled all their frontline bowlers in the powerplay, and none was spared. And with that Mumbai had put on their highest powerplay score of IPL 2020.</li>
            <li class="news-page-more">If there was a way to negate the dew factor, it'd have been through striking early. Trent Boult and Jasprit Bumrah gave Mumbai a start that was the stuff of dreams. First Boult played with Prithvi Shaw's tentativeness and had him edging a straightforward delivery angled across. While Shaw paid the price for playing non-existent swing back in, Ajinkya Rahane was trapped LBW with one that did swing in. And Bumrah topped it off by yorking Shikhar Dhawan in the next over. The scorecard reading 0 for 3 for the first time ever in IPL history summarised a sorry tale for Delhi Capitals.</li>
            <li class="news-page-more">Mumbai Indians found Bumrah answering any challenges thrown at them even after this. When Shreyas Iyer drove him for a boundary, Bumrah responded by having him caught at short cover next ball. A sprightly Marcus Stoinis found company in an equally spirited Axar Patel after Rishabh Pant holed out for just 3. The duo put on a quick 71-run stand briefly raising Delhi's hopes again when Rohit turned back to Bumrah. He responded by making a mess of Stoinis' stumps first ball, and then get Daniel Sams gloving back in the same over. Finishing with top class figures of 4-14, Bumrah helmed Mumbai's successful defence and gave them a rightful spot in the final.</li>
