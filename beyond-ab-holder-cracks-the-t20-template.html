            <h2>Beyond AB and Reputation, Holder cracks the T20 template.</h2>
            <li class="news-page-more">Last week, when Sunrisers Hyderabad took on Royal Challengers Bangalore in Sharjah, one of the narratives revolving around the game was the potential clash between Jason Holder and AB de Villiers. The popular opinion was that de Villiers was going to go after Holder... again. De Villiers did teach Holder a harsh lesson in 2015 when he registered the fastest ODI hundred and a month later, the same treatment was meted out to him in a World Cup clash as well.</li>
            <li class="news-page-more">After more than five years, the odds were indeed stacked against Holder on October 31. Sharjah had this reputation for being a bowler's nightmare in the IPL this year and de Villiers's strike rate at the death was quite astonishing that set up an enticing but one-sided match-up. But in what turned out to be an anti-climax, de Villiers never got to face Holder in that game as he was dismissed with 9 overs left in the innings.</li>
            <li class="news-page-more">Holder has come a long way from that 2015 mauling. He was the only member in that 15-man T20 World Cup winning West Indies squad in 2016 to never get a game. It's been almost seven years since he made his debut in this format for West Indies but Holder has only played 17 games in total. While his Test stocks were on the rise constantly, Holder was never a first choice in that T20I lineup. In order to break into that XI, he had to compete against the likes of Dwayne Bravo, Andre Russell and Carlos Brathwaite over the years. His no-show in the IPL since 2016 was a direct consequence of that with the more established T20 stars from the Caribbean fetching gigs ahead of the Test and ODI captain over the years.</li>
            <li class="news-page-more">Ever since he forayed into the IPL in 2013 for Chennai Super Kings, Holder has featured in just 11 games in total until the 2020 edition. The auction last year was ill-timed as well as he had conceded 142 runs in 12 overs in the T20I series against India that concluded just 8 days before his name came up. So for a fourth straight year in a row, he was set to miss the biggest T20 carnival in the world. It certainly wasn't ideal for a player at the peak of his career with two T20 World Cups coming up in the space of 12 months. But a determined Holder did put in the hard yards and the signs were already evident in the CPL that concluded just before the start of the IPL.</li>
